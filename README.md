# advent-of-code

My solutions for advent of code (2021 and some older ones)

Mostly naive, basic-python or numpy solutions. Basically, not golfing, not the most efficient or beautiful solutions. But it was fun!


## Random notes

- I have input files as either txt, num or csv files. The main difference is that csv files always have a fixed number of columns given a certain delimiter (the delimiter is not always a comma!). Num files are like "1,2,3,4". Txt is the most unstructured, and are read as just a list of strings (and parsed in the program itself.
- For some problems where the input is really short, I have the input directly in the notebook. However, I don't like manual pre/postprocessing, so I try to just directly copy/paste from the website.
- In keeping with the previous point, unless I missed something or I got frustrated (e.g. 202020), the notebooks should all print the answers when ran noninteractively, even with a different input. No 'interpreting' the output should be neccecary.
